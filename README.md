## 1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Image of Summary](/resources/summary_deliv_1.png)
The vehicle length and ground clearance had a significant effect on miles per gallon in this regression model. The p-values for each variable were well below .001, meaning these contributions were not random and in fact a direct correlation. Due to the linear relationships found in this model, it is inaccurate to say that the slopes of the regression lines are zero. The adjusted R-squared value is 0.6825, meaning this model accounts for 68.25% of the variance seen in miles per gallon. This model does not predit miles per gallon very accurately, as there is a significant portion of variance missing.
