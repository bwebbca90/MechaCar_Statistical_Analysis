## 1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Image of Summary](/images/summary_deliv_1.png)
The vehicle length and ground clearance had a significant effect on miles per gallon in this regression model. The p-values for each variable were well below .001, meaning these contributions were not random and in fact a direct correlation. Due to the linear relationships found in this model, it is inaccurate to say that the slopes of the regression lines are zero. The adjusted R-squared value is 0.6825, meaning this model accounts for 68.25% of the variance seen in miles per gallon. This model does not predit miles per gallon very accurately, as there is a significant portion of variance missing. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Per design specifications for MechaCar, the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The variance that captures all lots across the dataset indicate that the variance falls within the specifed limits.

According to the variance information for each individual lot, however, only Lots 1 and 2 meet the required specifications. Lot 3, with a variance of more than 170, does not. This could indicate a manufacturing issue within Lot 3.
